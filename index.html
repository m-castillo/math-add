			<p id="instruction1">Read before you start.</p>

			<ul id="steps">
				<li>You have to add the numbers you see on the screen. You can use your spiral, a pencil and an eraser, or a whiteboard with a marker (make sure it is not a Sharpie!)</li>
				<li>You will have 1 minute to solve as many problems you can. See the timer on the top section of the screen.</li>
				<li>When the minute is over, you will see how many problems you solved correctly.</li>
				<li>It does NOT matter how many you solve the first time. But you have to be better every time you play.</li>
				<li>You can play with a friend, with your brother or sister, or even with your parents! Perhaps one of your teachers can play with you!</li>
				<li>When you are ready, click on the button below and start playing. Have fun!</li>
